# event-planner
Event planner with leaflet for location handling!

this project was requested by a friend of mine, and so I built him a simple event planner with the ability to make events and mark attending, as well as specify a location using the Leaflet library.

At present, we are using a boilerplate react-calendar for styling! Very exciting stuff.
